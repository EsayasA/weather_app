 we decide to go fetching of data from ApI sources like Api open weathermap.
then we enter to the website of Api weathermap and we create Account first and verify our email.
Then we create key value after that we go to the ApI and we select the Current Weather Data API DOC.After we enter to that page
we need to select the Api with city name, but there was no Api call with city name.
But we watch a lot of videos with the page of Api call with city name. so this was one of our first technical challenge.
But we continue using with longitude and latitude of the city to get the data of the cities temperature, pressure,
speed, humidty and others using the images of the above lists features.

So we copy the Api call and the keyvalue and we toke these values to the browser. We never realized that
it takes about 15 minute to fetch API data. We thought that was error and we tried to solve it.
that was very challenging until we got sources from YouTube
