## our inspiration with this project
When I was At compus almost all my Friends ware software Engineering students.<br>
so when they talk about their projects I was wonder how is this possible.<br>

But at that time I was on another department and I have not enough time to study both the departments at the same time.<br>
so I decide to finish the department I was started then I was planning to study software Engineering.<br>
I was watching them working a lot of project but I was shock the project they were talking about the <br>weather application.
it riases a lot of questions about the weather application.<br>
like how is the accourate data comes from, how it works for all the cities of the world,<br>
how do I know the weathers of the cities and other lot of questions.<br>
**so at that time I decide if I start learnig software Engineering weather application will be my first project.**


### challenges we been through
 After we finish our front end part,<br>

 we decide to go fetching of data from ApI sources like Api open weathermap.<br>
then we enter to the website of Api weathermap and we create Account first <br>
and verify our email.Then we create key value after that we go to the ApI and<br> 
we select the Current Weather Data API DOC.After we enter to that page<br>
we need to select the Api with city name, but there was no Api call with city name.<br>
But we watch a lot of videos with the page of Api call with city name. so this was one<br>
of our first technical challenge.But we continue using with longitude and latitude of the<br>
city to get the data of the cities temperature, pressure,speed, humidty and others using <br>
the images of the above lists features.<br>

So we copy the Api call and the keyvalue and we toke these values to the browser.<br>
We never realized thatit takes about 15 minute to fetch API data. We thought that <br>
was error and we tried to solve it.that was very challenging until we got sources from YouTube.<br>

##    we use the following Technologies for our portofilo project**
 **- For the Frontend we chose to use HTML,CSS and JavaScript<br>**
 **- For the backend part we use Javascript and API<br>**
 **- we use user Interface(UI) and user Experience(UX)<br>**
 **- after we finish working the project we will use Tester**
